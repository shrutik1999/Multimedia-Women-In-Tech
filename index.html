        <p id="firstp">While the disparity in the gender-based composition of the general American workforce has been considered a topic of concern in the past, the percentage of women in STEM fields continues to lag behind that of the male population. While the difference in female and male composition in the STEM workforce has existed for years, the attention to this issue has especially surfaced recently. Although the degree to which women constitute the STEM field has increased, women continue to be underrepresented in the workforce.</p>
        <p>According to the National Girls Collaborative Project in 2018, the greatest disparities are observed in the fields of engineering, computer science and the physical sciences — only 28% of the science and engineering workforce are women. Consciousness of this issue has brought about the establishment of numerous support foundations that aim to make this disparity more prevalent and shatter gender-based stereotypes.</p>
        <p>Jessie Arora, the executive director at Wogrammer, hopes to see more diverse role models in STEM presented in technology media and more. As a foundation that blends journalism and STEM, Wogrammer interviews female software engineers to feature their cutting-edge technology and tell their stories.</p>
        <p class="quote">“We are deeply inspired by the increased attention to showcase stories about women in STEM over the past several years,” Arora says. “We believe stories have the power to inspire, connect and create a positive narrative about being a woman in the tech industry.”</p>
        <p>Founded in August 2014 by Erin Summer and Zainab Ghadiyali, Wogrammer promotes its mission of shifting public conversation about women in technology from a gendered experience to one about personal accomplishments. Since its inception, Wogrammer has actively worked to initiate change, highlight achievements and inspire young women. What started as a simple Instagram project transformed into a global movement that has now featured over 200 female engineers from all seven continents. With over four million readers, the organization aspires to continue encouraging women’s involvement in the STEM field.</p>
        <p>Arora says the organization aims to not only empower its readers, but also the women it showcases. Sundas Khalid, a data scientist in Amazon’s A/B testing platform and Weblab, says her feature on Wogrammer helped her battle imposter syndrome and take pride in her accomplishments.</p>
        <p class="quote">“Women are more open to discussing issues that women in tech face at [Amazon],” Khalid says. “People are not afraid to call out a lack of diversity.”</p>
        <p>Khalid says that over the six years that she has worked at Amazon, she has seen a shift in the workplace’s openness to discussion about gender inclusivity. According to The Washington Post, Amazon’s 2014 diversity report revealed a workforce that is 63% male and 37% female. While the disparity continues to exist, Amazon’s diversity report from December 2018 revealed that the workforce is 58.3% male and 41.7% female.</p>

        <p>Like Wogrammer, other organizations aim to raise awareness to empower women and continue bridging the gap. As the first woman in her family to pursue a college degree and a career in STEM, Khalid notes the efforts of other organizations that encouraged her to push through. By attending every Grace Hopper Celebration since 2016 and starting the Seattle chapter of Pakistani Women in Computing, she says that she surrounded herself with the right support system to now help other women overcome their imposter syndrome.</p>
        <p class="quote">“I started getting involved in diversity initiatives at work and outside work,” Khalid says. “I saw [these women] flourishing in their careers despite being underrepresented. [They] became my motivation and gave me confidence [to say] that if they can do it, then so can I.”</p>
        <p>While efforts continue to be taken on a national level, the impact of such organizations appears to have trickled down to the collegiate level to aspiring women in technology. At the University of Maryland College Park, the Association for Women in Computing hopes to tackle imposter syndrome at its root and promote women’s pursuit of STEM careers.</p>
        <p>Kavya Dagli, the co-president of the university's Association for Women in Computing, says that AWC aims to incentivize women to work in STEM and supports them with annual social events.</p>
        <p class="quote">“We are creating a space to recognize that women are minorities in the computing space and encourage more to join,” Dagli says. “It’s nice to have a space that other women relate to… a space that’s vulnerable.”</p>
        <p>Dagli says that with nearly 100 members, AWC is moving toward becoming a more social organization rather than a career-driven one. By hosting events with IBM, Microsoft and other large companies, Dagli says AWC hopes to instill in women the confidence to participate in a male dominated field.</p>
